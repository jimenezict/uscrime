This is a tutorial for those that wants to put his hand on a ETL for understanding Cassandra stacks.

Easy, let's use some crime statistics from the USA and let's analyze it a little bit.

But first of all
* Do you have Cassandra node already. here, how I learned and configured. Pease of cake.
* Nothig to complain, if you are here, it means that you have your IDE or Python environment. I was using 3.7 and PyCharm

About the files.
* CQL scripts for creating the keyspace and tables
* Raw data with the crimes
* Python with the ETL. Check out that some manipulations are done (guess which)

Enjoy and don't hesitate to contact me in case of doubts.

Keep trying, keep learning, keep growing.

PD: in order to avoid you some console errors: install pandas, cassandra-drive and xlrd
